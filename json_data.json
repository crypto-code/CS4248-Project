        "text": "complex langevin (cl) dynamics\u00a0 [1,2] provides an approach to circumvent the sign problem in numerical simulations of lattice field theories with a complex boltzmann weight, since it does not rely on importance sampling. in recent years a number of stimulating results has been obtained in the context of nonzero chemical potential, in both lower and four-dimensional field theories with a severe sign problem in the thermodynamic limit\u00a0 [3\u20138] (for two recent reviews, see e.g.\u00a0refs.\u00a0 [9,10]). however, as has been known since shortly after its inception, correct results are not guaranteed\u00a0 [11\u201316]. this calls for an improved understanding, relying on the combination of analytical and numerical insight. in the recent past, the important role played by the properties of the real and positive probability distribution in the complexified configuration space, which is effectively sampled during the langevin process, has been clarified\u00a0 [17,18]. an important conclusion was that this distribution should be sufficiently localised in order for cl to yield valid results. importantly, this insight has recently also led to promising results in nonabelian gauge theories, with the implementation of sl(n,c) gauge cooling\u00a0 [8,10].\n",

(9)), for a system of finite number of particles. the partition function is a solution to the klein\u2013gordon equation, reproduces the van der waals isotherms away from the critical region and, in the thermodynamic limit n\u2192\u221e automatically encodes the maxwell equal areas rule. the approach hereby presented is of remarkable simplicity, has been successfully applied to spin\u00a0 [17\u201319,14,16] and macroscopic thermodynamic systems\u00a0 [20,15] and can be further extended to include the larger class of models admitting partition functions of the form (4) to be used to extend to the critical region general equations of state of the form (7) including a class virial expansions.\n",

        "text": "the control of the rp re-encounter probability finds a direct application to improve the performance of chemical devices. here, we show how a simple-to-implement control scheme highly enhances the sensitivity of a model chemical magnetometer by up to two orders of magnitude. the basic idea behind a chemical magnetometer is that, since a change in the magnetic field modifies the amount of singlet products, one can reverse the reasoning and measure the chemical yield to estimate b. intuitively, the magnetic sensitivity is high when a small change in the magnetic field intensity produces large effects on the singlet yield. formally, it is defined as:(2)\u03bbs(b)\u2261\u2202\u03c6s(b)\u2202b=\u222b0\u221epre(t)gs(b,t)dt,with gs(b,t)\u2261\u2202fs(b,t)\u2202b being the instantaneous magnetic sensitivity. the functional form of fs(b,t)=s\u03c1el(t)s strongly depends on the specific realization of the radical pair, in particular on the number of the surrounding nuclear spins. here, we consider a radical pair in which the first electron spin is devoid of hyperfine interactions, while the second electron spin interacts isotropically with one spin-1 nucleus, e.g. nitrogen. in the context of the chemical compass (i.e. when the task is determining the magnetic field direction through anisotropic hyperfine interactions), an analogous configuration (with only one spin-1/2 nucleus) has been proposed [3], and numerically characterized [8], as being optimal: additional nuclear spins would perturb the intuitive \u2018reference and probe\u2019 picture. the hamiltonian then simplifies to h=-\u03b3eb(s1(z)+s2(z))+|\u03b3e|\u03b1s\u21922\u00b7i\u2192, where \u03b1 is the isotropic hyperfine coupling.\n",

[21] the hamiltonian consists of a 1-dimensional tunnelling mode coupled to an (m\u22121)-dimensional harmonic bath, hence it is a system-bath problem which bears some similarity to the caldeira-leggett model of tunnelling in a dissipative system [22,23]. this hamiltonian is non-dissipative, however and the harmonic modes all have the same frequency. system-bath models play an important role in physics, being used to describe superconductivity at a josephson junction in a superconducting quantum interface device (squid) [24], for which the caldeira-leggett model provides a theoretical basis, and magnetic and conductance phenomena in the spin-bath regime [25].\n",

        "text": "this study proposes a new framework of a numerical modelling of the gas exchange between air and water across their interface, and subsequent chemical reaction in water based on an extended two-compartment model. the major purpose of this study is to provide a fundamental concept for modelling physicochemical processes of the gas exchange, followed by the chemical reaction in water. demonstrating fundamental data and knowledge on the important environmental transport phenomena, especially the effects of the schmidt number and the chemical reaction rate on the gas exchange mechanisms across the interface have also been attempted. the gas exchange processes are separated into two physicochemical substeps, the first is the gas\u2013liquid equilibrium between the two phases, and the second is the chemical reaction in the water phase. a first-order, irreversible chemical reaction of the gaseous material after its uptake into the water phase is assumed here to simplify interactions of the chemical reactions and turbulent transport phenomena in water. while a traditional two-compartment model assumes uniform concentration of a material in each compartment, the present two-compartment model uses a computational fluid dynamics (cfd) technique in the water compartment to evaluate temporal development of three-dimensional profiles of the velocity and concentration fields. a direct numerical simulation (dns) approach is used to evaluate profiles of fluid velocities and concentrations in water, and several important turbulence statistics have been evaluated without using turbulent closures, and subgrid-scale models. we assume that a fluid flow in the water phase is a well-developed turbulent water layer of a low reynolds number, and the schmidt number is varied from 1 to 8 to observe the effects of the molecular diffusion of the gas in sub-interface water on the gas exchange rate at the interface. six degrees of the nondimensional chemical reaction rate are used to find the effect of the chemical reaction rate on the gas exchange mechanisms. extrapolations of the gas exchange rates and the related transport phenomena toward larger schmidt number and the faster chemical reaction rate will also be examined to predict the gas exchange processes of the actual gases of sc\u223co(102) based on results from the present numerical experiments.\n",

[9], although they do not allude to specific oxide phases, have shown that small ti additions to an 18%cr ods alloy dramatically reduces the coarsening rates of dispersoids when compared to an equivalent alloy without titanium. for example, ribis indicates that coarsening rates may be controlled by interfacial energy between the secondary phase particles and the matrix; he points out that the resistance to coarsening observed in the y, ti, o system is probably the result of a very low interface energy and this would differ from one phase to another. whittle et al. [10] have shown that pyrochlore and structures closely related to the pyrochlore structure respond in different ways to irradiation. they revealed that oxide structure and variations in composition can affect their ability to withstand and recover from irradiation induced damage.\n",

[4] took a more systematic approach to such glass-ceramic wasteforms. these wasteforms were targeted at hanford k-basin sludges and the immobilisation of the primary waste stream from production of molybdenum-99 at the australian nuclear science and technology organisation site in sydney respectively. in the work of carter et al. and zhang et al. the intended crystalline phase was the closely related titanate pyrochlore, cauti2o7. the glass matrix was formulated such that the trivalent species in the glass network, boron and aluminium, were charge compensated on a molar basis by sodium. the stoichiometric composition of the glass in this wasteform was na2albsi6o16. this glass provides a method by which the glass composition can be varied systematically. given that the initial observations inferred an important role played by alumina, it was decided to prepare a suite of zirconolite glass-ceramics in which the glass matrix was defined by na2al1+xb1\u2013xsi6o16 to investigate the role played by glass composition in controlling crystalline phase stability. the x=1 end member gives the mineral albite, naalsi3o8. the melting point of albite is 1120\u00b0c [5] and the composition cools to a glass at the cooling rates that occur during a hip cycle. from the available phase diagrams, [6] no boron analogue for albite was shown, and the liquidus estimated from the relevant phase diagram is 1100\u20131200\u00b0c. no phase diagrams for the quaternary system na2o\u2013al2o3\u2013b2o3\u2013sio2 could be found.\n",

(2014) reviewed various methods for the calculation of the cell temperature in high concentrator pv (hcpv) modules. the methods were categorised based on: (1) heat sink temperature, (2) electrical parameters and (3) atmospheric parameters. the first two categories are based on direct measurements of cpv modules in indoor or outdoor experimental setups and presented the highest degree of accuracy (root mean square error (rmse) 1.7\u20132.5k). most of the methods reviewed by rodrigo et al. (2014) calculate the cell temperature at open-circuit conditions. methods that predict the cell temperature at maximum power point (mpp) operation offer a more realistic approach since they include the electrical energy generation of the solar cells (i.e. real operating conditions); yandt et al. (2012) described a method predicting the cell temperature at mpp based on electrical parameters and fern\u00e1ndez et al. (2014b) based on heat sink temperature with absolute rmse 0.55\u20131.44k. fern\u00e1ndez et al. (2014a) also proposed an artificial neural network model to estimate the cell temperature based on atmospheric parameters and an open-circuit voltage model based on electrical parameters (fernandez et al., 2013a) offering good accuracy (rmse 3.2k and 2.5k respectively (rodrigo et al., 2014)). the main disadvantage of the aforementioned methods is that an experimental setup is required to obtain the parameters used for the cell temperature calculation.\n",

        "text": "gas sorption, storage and separation in carbon materials are mainly based on physisorption on the surfaces and particularly depend on the electrostatic and dispersion (i.e., vdw) interactions. the former can be tuned by introducing charge variations in the material, and the latter by chemical substitution. the strength of the interaction is determined by the surface characteristics of the adsorbent and the properties of targeted adsorbate molecule, including but not limited to the size and shape of the adsorbate molecule along with its polarizability, magnetic susceptibility, permanent dipole moment, and quadrupole moment. li et al. summarise the adsorption-related physical parameters of many gas or vapour adsorbates, and herein table 1 we show a few of those of interest, h2, n2, co, co2, ch4, nh3, so2 and h2s [90]. for instance, an adsorbent with a high specific surface area is a good candidate for adsorption of a molecule with high polarizability but no polarity. adsorbents with highly polarised surfaces are good for adsorbate molecules with a high dipole moment. the adsorbents with high electric field gradient surfaces are found to be ideal for the high quadrupole moment adsorbate molecules [91]. normally, the binding or adsorption strength with a carbon nanostructure is relatively low for h2 and n2; intermediate for co, ch4 and co2; and relatively high for h2s, nh3 and h2o. thus, surface modifications, such as doping, functionalization and improving the pore structure and specific surface area of nanocarbons, are important to enhance gas adsorption. for this purpose, graphene offers a great scope for tailor-made carbonaceous adsorbents.\n",

[228] developed an analytic model that takes into account geometrical factors as well as surface diffusion. this model accurately predicted the porosity and deposition rate of thin films using a single input parameter related to the cross-sectional area of the nanocolumns, the volume of material and the thickness of the film. moreover, in ref. [39], an analytical semi-empirical model was presented to quantitatively describe the aggregation of columnar structures by means of a single parameter dubbed the fan angle. this material-dependent quantity can be experimentally obtained by performing deposition at normal incidence on an imprinted groove seeded substrate, and then measuring the increase in column diameter with film thickness. this model was tested under various conditions [40], which returned good results and an accurate prediction of the relation between the incident angle of the deposition flux and the tilt angle of the columns for several materials.\n",

        "text": "it has been known [9,14,18,22] that the fragmentation processes in polyatomic molecules induced by an intense ultrafast laser field can sometimes exhibit sensitive dependence on the instantaneous phase characteristics of the laser field. depending on the change in sign the chirped laser pulses, fragmentation could be either enhanced or suppressed [14,18,22]. controlling the outcome of such laser induced molecular fragmentation with chirped femtosecond laser pulses has brought forth a number of experimental and theoretical effects in the recent years. however, efforts are continuing for a specific fragment channel enhancement, which is difficult since it also is a function of the molecular system under study [20,22\u201324]. here we report the observation of a coherently enhanced fragmentation pathway of n-propyl benzene, which seems to have such specific fragmentation channel available. we found that for n-propyl benzene, the relative yield of c3h3+ is extremely sensitive to the phase of the laser pulse as compared to any of the other possible channels. in fact, there is almost an order of magnitude enhancement in the yield of c3h3+ when negatively chirped pulses are used, while there is no effect with the positive chirp. moreover, the relative yield of all the other heavier fragment ions resulting from interaction of the strong field with the molecule is not sensitive to the sign of the chirp, within the noise level.\n",

        "text": "as already discussed, in dilute flows the choice between the hard sphere and soft sphere models largely depends on the computational time spent to solve the particle equation of motion. for very dilute flows, the hard sphere model is the most natural choice. however, when the collisions can no longer be assumed as binary and instantaneous, the soft sphere model is the only realistic option. it is interesting to know whether the choice of the collision model affects the statistics. fig. 14 compares the mean velocity obtained from both models with the experimental data. the same comparison is performed for the smooth walls. the differences between the hard and soft sphere models for the smooth walls are almost negligible. however, the differences between the hard and soft sphere models for the rough walls are minor. this is because the rough wall treatment in the soft sphere implementation adds extra virtual walls during the collision of a particle with a wall, which is a more realistic representation of a rough wall compared to the hard sphere rough wall treatment where one random wall is considered. this is because, a soft sphere collision is not instantaneous and occurs over a finite amount of time. similarly, the same effects are observed on the fluid statistics. however, fig. 15, which compares the particle velocity fluctuations, shows that the differences are somewhat larger. additionally, the differences in both particle mean and rms velocity profiles are because the hard sphere collisions are unfortunately heavily dependent on the tangential coefficient of restitution (\u03c8); the effects by varying this quantity are shown in figs. 16 and 17.\n",

(2012), are performed. the well-documented horizontal channel flow case described in kussin and sommerfeld (2002), who study spherical particles, is used as a reference case. the measurements in their work was done with phase doppler anemometry (pda), to measure the fluid and particle velocity simultaneously. the numerical framework applied in this paper has been previously validated for spherical particles in mallouppas and van wachem (2013). in that paper, it is shown that the comprehensive discrete element model (dem) is more accurate in determining the behaviour of the particles in this horizontal gas\u2013solid channel flow that the hard-sphere model. moreover, this paper showed that the fluid mechanics are accurately modelled using the les framework. in the current paper, this framework is extended to account for non-spherical particles.\n",

        "text": "the statistical associating fluid theory (saft) is a well-developed perturbation theory used to describe quantitatively the volumetric properties of fluids. the reader is referred to several reviews on the topic which describe the various stages of its development and the multiple versions available [50\u201353]. the fundamental difference between the versions is in the underlying intermolecular potential employed to describe the unbounded constituent particles. hard spheres, square well fluids, lj fluids, argon, alkanes have all been employed as reference fluids in the different incarnations of saft. for the purpose of this work we will center on a particular version of the saft eos, i.e. the saft-vr mie recently proposed by laffitte et al. [54] and expanded into a group contribution approach, saft-\u03b3, by papaioannou et al. [55]. this particular version of saft provides a closed form eos that describes the macroscopical properties of the mie potential [56], also known as the (m,n) potential; a generalized form of the lj potential (albeit predating it by decades). the mie potential has the form(1)\u03d5(r)=c\u03b5\u03c3r\u03bbr\u2212\u03c3r\u03bbawhere c is an analytical function of the repulsive and attractive exponents, \u03bba and \u03bbr, respectively, \u03c3 is a parameter that defines the length scale and is loosely related to the average diameter of a mie bead; \u025b defines the energy scale and corresponds to the minimum potential energy between two isolated beads; expressed here as a ratio to the boltzmann constant, kb. the mie function, as written above, deceivingly suggests that four parameters are needed to characterize the behaviour of an isotropic molecule, however the exponents \u03bba and \u03bbr are intimately related, and for fluid phase equilibria, one needs not consider them as independent parameters [57]. accordingly, we choose herein to fix the attractive exponent to \u03bba=6 which would be expected to be representative of the dispersion scaling of most simple fluids and refer from here on to the repulsive parameter as \u03bb=\u03bbr. the potential simplifies to(2)\u03d5(r)=\u03bb\u03bb\u22126\u03bb66/(\u03bb\u22126)\u03b5\u03c3r\u03bb\u2212\u03c3r6\n",
